This repository contains all code to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

## Overview
Implementations of the models in R and Python can be found in the folders `neat/R` and `neat/Python`, respectively.
The Python implementation further contains the hyperparameter search described in the appendix of the paper.

The folder `benchmarks` contains the code to run the benchmarks mentioned in the paper, including the code to preprocess the data.

The folder `application` contains the code used in the `Covid`, `Elec`, `Wine`, `Survival`, and `Yeast` experiments.

Code shared between the different experiments can be found in the folder `common`.
